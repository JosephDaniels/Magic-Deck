# Magic Deck Stack

Hello! Welcome to Magic Deck Stack. Version # 1.01

Last Updated: April 25th, 2019 @ 4:58am

This is the pygame app designed for Windows.

This is an early access pygame build that I started working on one day. If I had to guess, the day was around March 15th, 2018.  I got the idea while I was looking for stacked deck programs. I realized I might as well code one and figure out how to make it myself.

This build is focused on creating a stable gui for pygame that lets you view all the neat stack things in a stable pygame build.

We tried to create a really simple and nice to look at program that would solve our deck stack problems and questions.

The point was to be able to show the deck in its initial state, and by clicking buttons, be able to show the permutations that are created in the deck by shuffling.

I think that its most useful for my own favorite stack, memorandum which is based on the Faro-4.

We start from New Deck Order. This is the order that you get when you first open the card box. I know that not every deck is like this, but this is how I find the decks that come from the Bicycle Company.

First, we go to mirror stack. You can go to the mirror stack in the stack list. This is done physically by cutting the section of clubs to the top.

Click the shuffle > faro button 4 times.

From there, you can see it is a few simple changes to get to the final result, which is the memorandum stack.

You can find out more about the memorandum stack in Woody Aragon's fantastic book: "Memorandum"

This book really inspired me to create this program, so I could see what was happening to the deck as I shuffled and changed it to my needs. But I wanted a way to visualize what was happening.
