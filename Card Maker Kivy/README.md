## Getting started

pip will help you a lot during this process.

Open up an elevated power shell with (cntrl+shift+enter).

Ensure you have the latest pip installed and other useful setup utilities.
If you don't have pip, wheel and setuptools, run these:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools

Install pygame with pip.
python -m pip install pygame

Currently, this program only works under python 2.7.
I hope to eventually bring support to the newer versions of python. (3.5+)
For now, you need to install python27 and install all your modules there.

Ensure your python27 runs in your cmd prompt.

Run this next:
python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew
python -m pip install kivy.deps.gstreamer

Install kivy:
python -m pip install kivy

## Purpose

The point of this app is to systematically create a full deck of cards from a
series of alphanumeric images that correspond to the Values and Suits of a deck
of cards.

The idea is that the images are arbitrary, so you can use any image.
Whatever the inputs that are given, a deck is created from the symbols and they
then create a series of images from 1-52 that resemble somewhat a deck of cards.

The cards themselves can then be created from drawings given to the program from
use inputs, so that people can make their very own distinctive and personal
deck of cards from their own drawings and doodles.

## How to use this program

This part is under construction, wear a hardhat, man!
