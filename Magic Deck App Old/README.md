# Magic Deck Stack
------

Hello! Welcome to Magic Deck Stack. Version # 1.0

This is an early access pygame build that I started working on one day. I got the idea while I was looking for stacked deck programs. I realized I might as well code one and figure out how to make it myself.

This build is focused on creating a stable gui for pygame that lets you view all the neat stack things in a stable pygame build.

----

We tried to create a really simple and nice to look at program that would solve our deck stack problems and questions.

### Program Requirements
You need pygame.

We start from New Deck Order. This is the order that you get when you first open the card box. I know that not every deck is like this, but this is how I find the decks that come from the Bicycle Company.

### Getting started

Ensure you have pygame installed.

Then, you need to run the main.py.

 All other requirements are in this folder. If you wanted the kivy app you need to look in the other folder.
