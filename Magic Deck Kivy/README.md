## Getting started

pip will help you a lot during this process.

Open up an elevated power shell with (cntrl+shift+enter).

Ensure you have the latest pip installed and other useful setup utilities.
If you don't have pip, wheel and setuptools, run these:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools

Install pygame with pip.
python -m pip install pygame

Currently, this program only works under python 2.7.
I hope to eventually bring support to the newer versions of python. (3.5+)
For now, you need to install python27 and install all your modules there.

Ensure your python27 runs in your cmd prompt.

Run this next:
python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew
python -m pip install kivy.deps.gstreamer

Install kivy:
python -m pip install kivy

Last you can grab garden components: (DO NOT NEED, THEY ARE NOT YET USED.)
garden install XPopup
garden install iconfonts
garden install animationbuilder
